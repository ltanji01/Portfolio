## Summary of Review Classifier Project:
This project was assigned was during the Intro. to Machine Learning course (CS135) at Tufts University in the Fall 2023 semester.

Students had to build two logistic regression classifier that takes a single sentence review and determines if it has a positive or negative sentiment. For the first classifier, Bag-of-Words (BoW) vector had to be used for feature representation. The second classifier could use any feature representation and classifier.
